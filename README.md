# DSA Repository

This repository contains C++ implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts. Each file demonstrates a specific algorithm or data structure, making it easy for learners to understand and practice DSA in C++.

## Contents
- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Array Problems
- String Problems
- Bit Manipulation
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Vectors and Pointers
- Practice Questions

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aditya1122git/DSA.git
   ```
2. Open the folder in your C++ IDE or editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. Compile and run any `.cpp` file to see the output and understand the logic.
   Example (using g++):
   ```
   g++ mergeSort.cpp -o mergeSort.exe
   ./mergeSort.exe
   ```
